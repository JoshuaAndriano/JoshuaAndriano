### Hello Ladies and Gentleman! This is your Captain Speaking I'm Joshua Andriano👋

Welcome to my profile! Although I start with a captain's greeting, on land I'm better known as someone who is enthusiastic about the world of web development, UI/UX design, Formula 1, and Sim Racing.

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an enthusiastic beginner exploring the world of web development. Currently, my main focus is building a strong foundation in **React** and **Next.js**. I'm also on a journey to understand **Python** which I will use for data engineering and machine learning in the future.

I have a great interest in creating engaging and intuitive user experiences, which is why I'm also interested in **UI/UX design**.

### 🏎️ Beyond the Code

Outside the world of coding, I'm a huge **Formula 1** fan and proudly support the **Mercedes-AMG Petronas F1 Team**. I also enjoy the thrill of racing through **Sim Racing**, which I think has many similarities to the development process: it requires focus, strategy, and precise execution!
